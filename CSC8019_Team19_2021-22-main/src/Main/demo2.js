                                <p>Auckland Castle, which is also known as Auckland Palace and to people that live locally as the Bishop's Castle or Bishop's Palace, is located in the town of Bishop Auckland in County Durham, England. In 1832, this castle replaced Durham Castle as the official residence of the Bishops of Durham.[1] It is now a tourist attraction, but still houses the Bishop's offices; the Castle is a Grade I listed building.</p>

                                <p>The Auckland Project is a regeneration charity working to establish Bishop Auckland as a heritage visitor destination. We provide days out that feed the minds, bodies and spirits of both our visitors and local communities. Through historic attractions, galleries, nature, food, events and stays, The Auckland Project brings the rich and surprising story of Bishop Auckland to life for tourists. And in turn, the profits and opportunities created by our historic attractions and community engagement work, will help us create a bright future for this forgotten, post-industrial town.</p>

                                <p>Unfortunately, the Walled Garden is not accessible to wheelchairs yet. We are working with the designers for the Upper Walled Garden to ensure a lift is in place, and we look forward to welcoming everyone to the Garden when that section is finished.</p>
